# Learning Utsav - 30 Days of Learning

I am participating in Learning Utsav, organized by Kantipur Engineering College, Dhapakhel, turning my Dashain/Tihar celebrations into a period of growth and learning. Over the next 30 days, I will be focusing on mastering the basics of Machine Learning and documenting my progress, challenges, and achievements right here on GitHub.

## Structure:
- **Daily Time Commitment:** 2-3 hours
- **Learning Method:** Focus on theory, practical coding, and mini-projects.
- **Resources:** Books, online tutorials, documentation, and practical exercises.
## Let's Learn Together:
Join me in making this festive season a **Festival of Learning**!
