# Day 30 - Getting Started with Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Python

## Overview
On Day 30, we introduced the fundamentals of Natural Language Processing (NLP) using Python and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). The session covered essential NLP concepts, explored various corpora, and implemented basic text processing tasks to lay the groundwork for more advanced techniques.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Introduction to NLP
- **Definition:** Automated generation, manipulation, and analysis of human languages.
- **Key Areas:**
  - **Tokenization:** Splitting text into tokens (words, punctuation).
  - **POS Tagging:** Assigning parts of speech to each token.
  - **Parsing:** Analyzing the grammatical structure of sentences.
  - **Machine Translation:** Translating text from one language to another.

### 2. Python for NLP
- **Why Python:** 
  - Easy to learn with a shallow learning curve.
  - Extensive libraries and community support.
- **NLTK:** 
  - A comprehensive library for NLP tasks.
  - Provides modules and corpora for various linguistic operations.

### 3. Exploring NLTK Corpora
- **Corpora Used:**
  - **Brown Corpus:** Standard American English texts.
  - **Gutenberg Corpus:** Classic literature from Project Gutenberg.
  - **Stopwords Corpus:** Common stop words across multiple languages.
- **Tasks Implemented:**
  - Loading and inspecting corpora.
  - Counting total and unique words using `FreqDist`.
  - Identifying the most frequent words.

### 4. Practical NLP Tasks
- **Task 1: Exploring Corpora**
  - Loaded `austen-persuasion.txt` from the Gutenberg corpus.
  - Calculated total words and unique words.
  - Identified the top 10 most frequent words.
  - Introduced Zipfâ€™s Law through frequency distribution visualization.
  
- **Task 2: Predicting Words**
  - Built a simple word predictor using `ConditionalFreqDist`.
  - Demonstrated generating a random sentence based on word probabilities.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python 3
- **Libraries:** NLTK, Matplotlib, Random
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## Key Takeaways
- **Fundamental Concepts:** Gained a solid understanding of basic NLP terminology and tasks.
- **Hands-On Experience:** Implemented practical examples to explore and analyze text corpora.
- **Statistical Insights:** Learned about word frequency distributions and their implications in language processing.
